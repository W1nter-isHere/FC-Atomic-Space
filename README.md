Fictioncraft: Atomic Space is mostly about tech, a bit of magic, and some exploring. There are over 630 quests in this modpack that will act as a comprehensive guide to your journey. You spawn on a icy dimension with no ore generation, a lot of radiation, and an extremely low temperature. There is no nether. You must explore the Overworld-2464's mantle, the Overworld-2464's inner core, the Twilight Forest, and the Overworld-2400's Dangerzone.

You have 3 ways to generate / obtain resources, and the methods will unlock for you after you progress. The first tier of resource generation is sky orchard (The tree mod in SkyFactory 4). The second tier will be a custom resource generation method (Will keep it as a little secret, but its about fluids). The third tier is through chickens. The amount of resoureces tier up as you tier up the resouce generation methods. You will need a good amount of resources during end game. Specially if you wanna go for the creative items.

There is a addtional tab of quests for people who likes to have some challenge, and go for the creative items. You will not need to get into extended crafting in normal progression. There is a quest line for you to guide you through the OP items crafting journey.
